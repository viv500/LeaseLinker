**Inspiration**
LeaseLinker: Revolutionizing the Housing Landscape Inspiration The dire state of the housing crisis in Canada spurred our team into action. Witnessing the urgency and severity of the issue, we were inspired to create LeaseLinker as a beacon of hope in the face of a challenging housing landscape.

**What it does**
LeaseLinker stands as a unique solution that connects individuals in different areas who are seeking temporary residence swaps. Focused primarily on university students on co-op, the platform strategically matches users intending to move, effectively freeing up homes and contributing to a more sustainable housing economy. This dynamic approach to housing aims to ease the strain on resources while providing a practical and beneficial solution.

**How we built it**
Employing cutting-edge technology, we constructed LeaseLinker as a robust React app. Leveraging JavaScript, Express, Node.js, CSS, and HTML, our development process prioritized efficiency and accessibility. The deployment on Netlify ensures seamless user interactions and accessibility.

**Challenges we ran into**
Our journey encountered several challenges, with a primary focus on crafting an appealing and user-friendly UI. We invested considerable time in delving into color psychology to create an interface that is not only visually pleasing but also contributes to a positive user experience. Additionally, integrating diverse design styles from team members required meticulous coordination and compromise to ensure a cohesive end product.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
Our proudest moment lies in the tangible impact LeaseLinker has on a nationwide crisis. As teenagers, we successfully connected with others in our demographic, collectively addressing a prominent societal issue. This accomplishment reflects the potential of youth-driven initiatives to bring about positive change.

**What we learned**
The development of LeaseLinker was an invaluable learning experience. It provided insights into the intricacies of UI/UX principles and the collaborative problem-solving required in real-world applications. The experience deepened our understanding of the challenges associated with addressing a national crisis and reinforced our commitment to seeking innovative solutions.

**What's next for LeaseLinker**
Looking ahead, LeaseLinker aims to expand its influence by reaching more demographics and refining its features. Our commitment to improving housing accessibility remains unwavering, driven by the belief that innovative solutions can fundamentally transform our communities for the better. We envision a future where LeaseLinker plays a pivotal role in reshaping the housing landscape for the benefit of all.
